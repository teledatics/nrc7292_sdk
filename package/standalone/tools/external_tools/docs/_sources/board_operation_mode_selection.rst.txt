NRC Board Operation Mode Selection and Power Supply
===================================================
The DIP switch on the NRC board can be configured to select one of the following three modes of operation:

.. warning::
   The DIP switch configurations described below assume that the board is oriented in a way that the **printed numeric indices** are positioned below, not above the DIP switch box. Different board versions may have different up-down DIP switch box orientation, even if the relative DIP switch box locations on the board remain the same.

1. Firmware Upload / RAM Operation
----------------------------------
    
    .. image:: images/dip_switch_download.png

DIP Switch Configuration: **HHHLLH**

This mode is used to both upload a RAM-mode firmware binary to the RAM for immediate execution or flash an XIP standalone firmware binary or other information to the non-volatile flash memory.

A 5V adapter is used to directly supply power to the NRC board.

2. Standalone Operation
-----------------------
    
    .. image:: images/dip_switch_standalone.png

DIP Switch Configuration: **HLLHLH**

This mode is used to run the standalone application contained in the stored XIP standalone firmware binary. 

A 5V adapter is used to directly supply power to the NRC board.


3. Raspberry Pi Host Operation
------------------------------

    .. image:: images/dip_switch_host.png

DIP Switch Configuration: **HHLLLH**

This mode is used to run the NRC board with a Raspberry Pi Host physically mounted below the module.

The Raspberry Pi host supplies power to the NRC board.

.. note::
   Most NRC tools only use **Firmware Upload / RAM Operation** mode. The exact modes of operation used by a given tool will be specified in the usage documentation.
